Another prominent temple is the Vishwanath Temple, dating back to 1627, dedicated to Lord Shiva and renowned for its erotic stone carvings. The Bhimsen Temple, constructed in 1680, honors Bhimsen from the Mahabharata and is celebrated among the Newa people for business and trade. The Taleju Bhawani Temple, originally built in 1640 and rebuilt in 1667, is a five-story temple revered as the personal deity of the Malla kings, showcasing the rich religious and architectural heritage of Patan.
